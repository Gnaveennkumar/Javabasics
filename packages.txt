=========
Packages
=========

-> Packages are used to group the classes , interfaces, exceptions and errors

-> In java language, so many classes, interfaces, Exceptions and Errors are already available.

		Ex: String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, Arrays, BufferedReader, Scanner etc....

-> Sun people divided predefined classes, interfaces, Exceptions into several packages

				1) java.lang

				2) java.io

				3) java.util

				4) java.sql

-> java.lang package is default package and it is available for all java classes by default.

-> If we want to use any predefined class which is not part of java.lang package then we have to import that class using 'import' keyword.

// Example Of predefined package import

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
	}
}

====================
User Defined Packages
====================

-> In our project we will create our own packages to organize project related classes & interfaces

-> To create a package we will use 'package' keyword

-> In java class, package statement should be in first line and class should have only one package statement.

-> We can create user-defined package like below

			ex:
					package  srini;

					package com.tcs.aadhar;
							com.tcs.aadhar.userRegistration

-> Sample package naming convention :  company-name.project-name.module-name


				com.ibm.irctc.admin
						AdminLogin.java
						AdminService.java
						Request.java

				com.ibm.irctc.user
						UserLogin.java
						UserService.java

				com.ibm.irctc.reports
						ReportService.java
						Request.java
						
						com.infosys.amazon.cart

Note: In project we can create 2 classes with same name in using 2 different packages.

package com.oracle;

public class Engine {

	public void start() {
		System.out.println("Engine starting...");
	}

}


package com.ibm;

import java.util.Scanner;
import com.oracle.Engine;

public class Car {

	public void drive() {

		Engine eng = new Engine();
		eng.start();
		
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

	}
}


Note:

1) In class, package statement should be in first line  (top)

2) After package statement we can write multiple import statements

3) import java.io.*  (it means all classes, interface, exceptions of io package will be imported) - not recommended

4) If 2 classes are in same package then import not required.
